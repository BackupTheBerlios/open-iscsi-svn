Introduction
-------------
Open iSCSI Projects is a high performance, transport independent,
multi-platform implementation of iSCSI protocol (RFC3720).

The Open-iSCSI is a from-scratch project licensed under GPL.

Installation
-------------
As of today, the Open-iSCSI Initiator requires a host running the
Linux operating system with a kernel version of 2.6.9. You need to
enable "Cryptographic API" under "Cryptographic options" in the
kernel config. You also need to enable "CRC32c CRC algorithm" if
you use header or data digests. They are the kernel options,
CONFIG_CRYPTO and CONFIG_CRYPTO_CRC32C, respectively.

The Open-iSCSI Initiator consists of kernel modules, a user space
daemon and management tools. The compilation of the kernel modules
require the path to above kernel sources:

	make KSRC=<kernel-src>

Configuration
-------------
The default configuration file is /etc/iscsid.conf. This file contains
only default configuration which might be overwritten with Discovery
or manualy updated via iscsiadm utility.

See the man page and the example file for the current syntax.
(no man page yet...)

Starting
-------------

Right now there is no installation script. Just load the module with
command:

	insmod iscsi_tcp.ko

after that start daemon:

	iscsid &

and use administration utility to add/remove/update Discovery records,
iSCSI Node records or monitor active iSCSI sessions:

	./iscsiadm --help


This file is not complete. We will appreciate if one could help us to
finilize it! Thanks a lot!
