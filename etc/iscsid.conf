# ============================================================================
# iSCSI Configuration File Sample - see iscsi.conf(5)
# ============================================================================
# 
# All of the configuration parameters described in this file are applied
# globally to all targets, unless they are overridden by a local setting. The
# three types of local categories that can override the global settings are:
#
#   Target Name (i.e., TargetName)
#   Network (i.e., Subnet or Address)
#   SCSI Routing Instance (i.e., DiscoveryAddress)
# 
# All parameters that are localized to one of the categories above must be
# indented by at least one white space or a tab character. If the parameter is
# not indented, it will be interpreted as a global parameter (see examples for
# each parameter).
#
# If more that one entry exists for any given parameter (either global or
# local), the last entry has precedence.
#
# If a parameter setting under the network category conflicts with a different
# setting of the same parameter under the discovery address or target name
# category (for the same target), the network setting will have precedence.
#
# If a parameter is not specified in the iscsi.conf file, the default setting is
# used. The default values for all parameters can be found in the readme file.
#
# In the sample settings shown below, the following definitions apply:
#     <text> = any alpha-numeric text string
#   <number> = any numeric text string
#  <address> = valid IP address of the form a.b.c.d[/e]
#   <portal> = valid portal address of the form a.b.c.d[:e]
#
# ----------------
# Network Category
# ----------------
# To localize parameters to targets on a particular network (i.e., to
# override the global settings), you need to use either the "Subnet" or
# "Address" settings. The format for the "Subnet" setting is a.b.c.d/e. In
# addition, multiple subnets can be specified by using a "," delimiter. An
# example of these settings would be:
#
#Subnet=10.4.100.0/24
#  or
#Subnet=10.4.100.1/24,10.5.100.1/24
#
# The format for "Address" is a.b.c.d and it too can have multiple values using
# a "," delimiter. An example of these settings would be:
#
#Address=10.4.100.0
#   or
#Address=10.5.101.4,10.5.101.5
# 
# The following parameters can be specified using the network category:
#
# 1) Connection Timeout Settings
# 2) Error Handling Timeout Settings
# 3) TCP Settings
#
# --------------------------
# Discovery Address Category
# --------------------------
# To localize parameters to targets found on a particular discovery address
# (i.e., to override the global settings), you need to use the
# "DiscoveryAddress" setting. The format for the "DiscoveryAddress" setting is
# a.b.c.d, a.b.c.d:e (where e is a TCP port number), or an instance name. An
# example of these settings would be:
#
#DiscoveryAddress=10.4.100.0
#  or
#DiscoveryAddress=10.4.100.1:3260
#  or
#DiscoveryAddress=scisrouter1
#
# The following parameters can be specified using the discovery address
# category:
#
# 1) Authentication Settings
# 2) ConnectionTimeout Settings
# 3) Continuous Discovery settings
# 4) AsyncEvent Notification Settings
#
# --------------------
# Target Name Category
# --------------------
# To localize parameters to targets identified by a particular target name
# (i.e., to override the global settings), you need to use the
# "TargetName" setting. The format for the "TargetName" setting is
# either the 'iqn' or 'eui' format. An example of these settings would be:
#
#TargetName=iqn.1987-05.com.cisco:00.0d1d898e8d66.t0
#
# The following parameters can be specified using the target name category:
#
# 1) CRC Settings
# 2) iSCSI Operational Parameter settings
# 3) Connection Timeout Settings
# 4) Session Timeout Settings
# 5) Error Handling Timeout Settings
# 6) TCP Settings
# 7) Enable/Disable targets

# sent to a target before failing the existing connection and initiating a new
# one, uncomment the following line:

#
# The global connection timeout settings can be overridden on a per target name,
# discovery address or IP address basis. An example of setting the
# "LoginTimeout" value to 12 seconds for just target iqn.1987-
# 05.com.cisco:00.0d1d898e8d66.t0 would be:

#  ConnFailTimeout=5
#
# If a third party multipathing application is being used,
# then the "ConnFailTimeout" should be set to smaller value
# such as 15. This value is just a guideline so the actual value will be
# dependent on the users operating environment.
#
# -------------------------------
# ERROR HANDLING TIMEOUT SETTINGS
# -------------------------------
# To globally specify the length of time to wait for an abort command to
